# Cope AI

Cope AI is a chatbot designed to help users cope with stress, emotional turbulence, and the wild ride of meme coin gambling—born from the chaotic inspiration of [pump.fun](https://pump.fun). Built with Gradio and powered by OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo, it’s a no-nonsense tool for venting and finding calm, wrapped in a clean, modern interface.

Hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/[your-username]/cope-ai) and running on CPU, this project is lightweight, easy to deploy, and ready to support anyone needing a digital shoulder.
